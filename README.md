# Airline project using Django

Based on CS50W week 4, [link here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/4/).

This project aims to consolidate some methods to create, edit and manipulate databases, using djando-admin CLI tool and a text editor.

Its just a replica of the project showed in the class. I will not implement 12 factor app rules (tests, CI/CD, isolation and so on).
